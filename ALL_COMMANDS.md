### How Commands Are Processed:

1. **You speak** → Beep signal
2. **Voice recognition** → Converts to text
3. **Command matching** → Finds the right action
4. **Execution** → Performs the task
5. **Confirmation** → Jarvis speaks result
6. **Ready again** → Waits for next command

### Fallback Behavior:
- If command not recognized → "I'm still learning that command, boss"
- Website not in database → Google search finds it automatically
- Application not found → Error message + suggestion

## 💡 Pro Tips:

**Natural Language**: Jarvis understands variations!
- "What time is it?" = "Time" = "Tell me the time"
- "Take a screenshot" = "Screenshot" = "Capture screen"
- "Shutdown" = "Shut down" = "Turn off computer"

**Smart Matching**: Say commands naturally!
- "Open Instagram" ✅
- "Can you open Instagram?" ✅
- "Please open Instagram" ✅

**Chaining**: Give commands one after another!
1. "Open YouTube"
2. "Volume up"
3. "Take screenshot"
4. "Goodbye"
