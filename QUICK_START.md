# 🚀 QUICK START GUIDE

## How to Use Jarvis

### Step 1: Launch
Double-click `run_jarvis.bat` or run `python jarvis_advanced.py`

### Step 2: You'll See
- 🤖 **Robot GUI appears CENTER of your screen**
- Status shows "STANDBY" in orange
- Message: "Say 'Hey Assistant' to activate"

### Step 3: Activate (ONLY ONCE!)
**Say**: "Hey Assistant"

- GUI will **FLASH** with activation animation
- Hear: **"Hello boss, how can I help you?"**
- Status turns **GREEN** "READY"
- You're now FULLY ACTIVATED!

### Step 4: Give Commands Continuously
After activation, just keep speaking commands:

🔊 **Beep** → Speak command → Command executes → **Beep** → Next command

**NO need to say "Hey Assistant" again!**

### Examples:
```
"Open Facebook" → Opens facebook.com
"Open Twitter" → Opens twitter.com
"What time is it?" → Tells time
"Take screenshot" → Captures screen
"Volume up" → Raises volume
```

### Step 5: Exit
**Say**: "Goodbye"

- Hear: "Goodbye boss!"
- GUI closes
- Program exits

## 🎯 Visual Feedback

### Status Colors
- 🟠 **STANDBY** → Waiting for wake word
- 🟢 **ACTIVATED** → Just activated
- 🟢 **READY** → Ready for commands
- 🟢 **LISTENING** → Recording your voice
- 🟠 **PROCESSING** → Recognizing speech

### Animations
- **Flash Effect** → Wake word detected

## 💡 Important Notes

✅ Say "Hey Assistant" **ONLY ONCE** at the start
✅ After activation, speak commands **directly** (no wake word needed)
✅ Wait for **beep sound** before each command
✅ Say "**Goodbye**" to close everything
✅ GUI is **centered** on your desktop
✅ Works with **ANY website name** (e.g., "Open Reddit", "Open Pinterest")

## 🎬 Full Example Session

```
YOU: (Run program)
JARVIS: (Shows GUI center screen, "STANDBY")

YOU: "Hey Assistant"
JARVIS: *FLASH* "Hello boss, how can I help you?"
        (Status: READY)

YOU: "Open Facebook"
JARVIS: "Opening Facebook" → Opens facebook.com
        (Status: READY, waiting...)

YOU: "What time is it?"
JARVIS: "It's 5:45 PM"
        (Status: READY, waiting...)

YOU: "Take screenshot"
JARVIS: "Taking screenshot" "Screenshot saved"
        (Status: READY, waiting...)

YOU: "Goodbye"
JARVIS: "Goodbye boss!" → GUI closes, exits
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**GUI not centered?**
- Should appear in middle of screen automatically

**Not listening after activation?**
- Wait for beep sound
- Check microphone is working

**Can't activate?**
- Speak clearly: "Hey Assistant"
- Check internet connection (needed for recognition)

**Want to close?**
- Say "Goodbye" OR
- Click red × button on GUI
