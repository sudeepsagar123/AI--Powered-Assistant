## 🔄 **Improved Fallback**

If Jarvis doesn't understand a command (like "download maar do"), it will now politely ask you to repeat instead of saying "I'm still learning".

**Example:**
YOU: "Download maar do"
JARVIS: "I didn't quite catch that. Could you please repeat?"

**Your assistant is now more human-like and polite!** 🤖❤️
